# NLI_study
A quick tour of multitask learning applied to natural language inference. 



You'll find precision about this project in the pdf file of the repository. Just some precision about the code in case you want to run it again. First, for multitask codes, I didn't solve the problem with the accelerate library, so you will probably need to install accelerate and restart the runtime to run the rest of the codes. Also, I didn't success to make it run with gpt. Concerning the code below there is an illustration of the link between the codes and the data generated by each :
